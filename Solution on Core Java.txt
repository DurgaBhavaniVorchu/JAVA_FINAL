Problem statement

Dropping bars
You are given a grid of size N * M where the top left square has coordinate
(1,1) and bottom right square has coordinate (N,M). You are given a coordinate(X,Y)
and you have rectangular bars of size L * B
You are dropping these bars randomly anywhere on the grid (the bar should be
inside the boundaries of the grid) one after the other until one falls on (X,Y).
Calculate the number of bars that are required to complete this action.
Input format
First line: T (number of test cases)
For each test case: Six space-separated integers N, M, L, B, X, and Y
Output format
Print the expected number of bars correctly up to exactly 6 places after the
decimal.
Constraints 
1<=T<=100
1<=N,M<=10000
1<=L,Y<=N
1<=B,X<=M
